# Agent Guidelines

## Mandatory Rules When Using AI Coding Agents

### 1. AI Prompt Logging (Automatic)

Prompts are **automatically logged** via hooks when you use any supported AI tool.
You do **not** need to manually update `PROMPT_LOG.md`.

Supported tools and their hook configs:
| Tool | Config file |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `.claude/settings.json` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/hooks.json` |
| OpenAI Codex | `.codex/hooks.json` |
| Gemini CLI | `.gemini/settings.json` |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/hooks/hooks.json` |

Logs are saved to `.ai-log/session.jsonl` and submitted automatically on `git push`.

### 2. Setup (One-time)

```bash
# Install git pre-push hook
bash scripts/setup_hooks.sh
```

`AI_LOG_SERVER` and `AI_LOG_API_KEY` are already set in `.env.example`.

### 3. Pull Request Requirements

- **Title**: Short description of the change
- **Description**: Must include:
  - Summary of changes
  - List of changed files

PR description format:

```
## Summary
<description of changes>

## Changes
- <list of changed files>
```

### 4. Rules for AI Agents

If you are an AI coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Codex, Gemini, etc.):

- **MUST NOT** create a PR without first ensuring `bash scripts/setup_hooks.sh` has been run
- **MUST** include a clear PR description with summary and changed files
- **DO NOT** commit `.ai-log/*.jsonl` files (they are gitignored)
- Logging happens automatically — do not ask users to log prompts manually

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
